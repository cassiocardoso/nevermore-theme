If you wish to disable italics, there is now a no-italic theme available. You will have access to both, select **Nevermore No Italics** as your color theme.

The font used in the preview is [Dank Mono](https://dank.sh/). If you wish a free alternative with support for font ligatures check:

I was inspired by the awesome work of Sarah Drasner in the [Night Owl](https://github.com/sdras/night-owl-vscode-theme) theme.
